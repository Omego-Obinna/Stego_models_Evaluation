# Stego_models_Evaluation
Part 1
# Adversarial Extraction Algorithms (Part 1)

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. Virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
   Code imports for both `unified_embed.py` and `unified_extract.py`, here is the **complete list of Python packages** that these two scripts depend on:

   ### ✅ Core and Standard Library Packages
   
   These are included with Python by default:
   
   * `os`
   * `time`
   * `hashlib`
   * `re`
   
   ### 📦 Third-Party Python Packages
   
   These must be installed via `pip`:
   
   | Package                                                                              | Purpose                                                                        |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | `opencv-python` (`cv2`)                                                              | Reading, writing, and manipulating image files (for LSB embedding/extraction). |
   | `numpy`                                                                              | Array manipulation and bit-wise operations.                                    |
   | `pandas`                                                                             | Data logging, results management, and CSV/table handling.                      |
   | `matplotlib`                                                                         | Visualization of results (e.g., BER, PSNR, SSIM).                              |
   | `seaborn`                                                                            | Statistical plotting for presentation and analysis.                            |
   | `scikit-image` (used as `from skimage.metrics import structural_similarity as ssim`) | Image quality metric (SSIM).                                                   |

   ### 📦 Suggested `pip install` command:
   
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-image
   ```

## Embedding

The `unified_embed_2.py` script performs both CMO adaptive embedding and Hybrid adaptive embedding in one pass. It reads from:

* `cover_images/` + `secret_messages.txt` for CMO embedding (outputs to `cmo_stego_adaptive/`).
* `cover_messages/` + fixed key for Hybrid embedding (outputs to `Hybrid_stego_images/`).

### Usage

```bash
python unified_embed_2.py
```

This script will:

1. Embed secrets into the CMO stego set and save to `cmo_stego_adaptive/`.
2. Embed secrets into the Hybrid stego set and save to `Hybrid_stego_images/`.
3. Compute and save embedding imperceptibility metrics (PSNR, SSIM) as CSV files.
4. Generate diagnostic plots (`*.png`) in the working directory.

---

## Extraction

The `unified_extract_well.py` script runs adversarial extraction for both CMO and Hybrid models. It reads from:

* `cmo_stego_adaptive/` + `cover_images/` for CMO extraction.
* `Hybrid_stego_images/` + `cover_messages/` for Hybrid extraction.

### Usage

```bash
python unified_extract_well.py
```

This script will:

1. Extract bit-vectors using variance-aware LSB extraction.
2. Unmask Hybrid payloads via brute-force key search over a small keyspace (e.g., 8-bit candidates).
3. Compute extraction performance metrics (BER, correlation).
4. Save results to CSV (e.g., `cmo_adaptive_extraction_results.csv`, `hybrid_adaptive_extraction.csv`).

---

## Metrics & Outputs

* **Embedding Metrics**:

  * `cmo_stego_results_adaptive.csv`
  * `hybrid_stego_results_adaptive.csv`

* **Extraction Metrics**:

  * `cmo_adaptive_extraction_results.csv`
  * `hybrid_adaptive_extraction.csv`

* **Plots**:

  * `cmo_adaptive_psnr.png`, `cmo_adaptive_ssim.png`
  * `hybrid_adaptive_psnr.png`, `hybrid_adaptive_ssim.png`

---

## Notes

* Ensure `secret_messages.txt` contains at least as many lines as there are cover images.
* For larger keyspaces in Hybrid extraction, adjust the candidate key generator in `unified_extract_well.py`.
* To reproduce results exactly, use the provided virtual environment or replicate the `requirements.txt`.
